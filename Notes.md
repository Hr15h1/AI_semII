### Basic statistical features of an image
<hr>

Statistical features of an image refer to the numerical values derived from the pixel intensities that help describe the image's texture, contrast, distribution and structure. It is also used to compute statistical measurements of the images consisting of image histogram, mean, median, standard deviation, etc. Image statistical analysis gives us an easily interpretable visual format of an image. It helps us to find typical problems in an image and visually improve it. 

The statistical features of an image can be divided into

* First Order Statistical features:
    1. Mean: It is the average intensity value of all pixels in the image.
